Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA, and Microservices
This repository demonstrates how to use Spring Boot with Hibernate and JPA for building a microservice-based architecture. It aims to provide a clean, modular, and scalable solution to manage data with relational databases and expose services as microservices.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: A framework to easily create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

Hibernate: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework to simplify database interactions.

JPA (Java Persistence API): Interface to interact with relational databases.

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database operations by using repositories.

Spring Cloud: Tools for building microservices, service discovery, and configuration management.

Spring Security: For securing microservices and implementing authentication/authorization.

Eureka Server: For service discovery.

Spring Cloud Config: For centralized configuration management.

Spring Boot Actuator: For monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications in production.

Features
RESTful Microservices: A set of microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

Data Persistence: Hibernate and JPA integrated for data persistence.

Service Discovery: Using Eureka for service registration and discovery.

Centralized Configuration: Using Spring Cloud Config to externalize application configuration.

Security: Implemented authentication and authorization with Spring Security.

Database Support: Integrated with MySQL/PostgreSQL (you can change based on your preference).

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Java 11 or later

Maven: For building the project.

MySQL/PostgreSQL (or any relational database): Ensure a database is available or set up locally.

Docker (optional): To run database or other services in containers.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Set up the database:

Create a database in MySQL/PostgreSQL and update the application.properties of each microservice to reflect the database configurations.

Example (MySQL):

properties
Copy
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
Build the project: To build all microservices and dependencies, run:

bash
Copy
mvn clean install
Run the Eureka Server (Service Discovery):

Navigate to eureka-server folder and run:

bash
Copy
mvn spring-boot:run
Eureka will run at http://localhost:8761.

Run the Microservices:

Navigate to each microservice folder (microservice1, microservice2, etc.) and run:

bash
Copy
mvn spring-boot:run
The microservices will be registered with the Eureka server.

Run the Spring Cloud Config Server:

Navigate to the spring-cloud-config folder and run:

bash
Copy
mvn spring-boot:run
API Endpoints
Microservice 1
GET /api/v1/resources – Fetch all resources.

POST /api/v1/resources – Create a new resource.

PUT /api/v1/resources/{id} – Update an existing resource.

DELETE /api/v1/resources/{id} – Delete a resource.

Microservice 2
GET /api/v1/details – Fetch details of resources.

GET /api/v1/details/{id} – Fetch details by ID.

Eureka Dashboard
http://localhost:8761/ – Eureka server dashboard to see all registered services.

Security
This project integrates Spring Security for basic authentication, JWT tokens, or OAuth for microservices. The default user is:

Username: admin

Password: admin

Configuration
The configuration is externalized using Spring Cloud Config. The properties files for each service can be modified in the spring-cloud-config repository.

Testing
Unit and integration tests are included for most of the microservices. To run the tests, use:

bash
Copy
mvn test
For integration testing between services, you can use Postman or any HTTP client to interact with the REST APIs.

Docker (Optional)
You can also run this project using Docker for easy deployment. Below are the steps:

Build Docker images for each service.

Use Docker Compose to bring up the services together.

Example docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy
version: '3'
services:
  eureka-server:
    image: eureka-server:latest
    ports:
      - "8761:8761"

  microservice1:
    image: microservice1:latest
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
    depends_on:
      - eureka-server
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
  
  microservice2:
    image: microservice2:latest
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
    depends_on:
      - eureka-server
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
